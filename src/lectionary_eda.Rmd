# Background

## What's a Lectionary?

A [lectionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectionary), according to Wikipedia, is a listing of scripture readings for Christian or Judaic worship on a given day. The Roman Catholic Lectionary will contain a list of readings for a specific day that are on a 3-year cycle. Here is an example:

Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time  
Lectionary: 149  
**Reading 1**: Jer 31:7-9  
**Psalm**: Ps 126:1-2, 2-3, 4-5, 6  
**Reading 2**: Heb 5:1-6  
**Gospel**: Mk 10:46-52

As a Catholic, I've often wondered how much of the Bible is included in the lectionary. Fortunately, Felix Just, S.J., Ph.D. compiled a [website with statistics](http://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/Statistics.htm) on many aspects of the lectionary which help to answer this question.

His analysis shows that a Catholic who attends Mass on Sundays and Feasts (but not weekdays) would hear **~ 4%** of the Old Testament (excluding Psalms) and **~ 41%** of the New Testament. Wow - this was a shock to me! I bet if you ask around you'll hear that many Catholics think the lectionary includes the whole Bible. To be fair, these numbers do get a bit higher if you include the complete lectionary (with weekdays). The total coverage of the Old Testament is **~14%** (again excluding Psalms) and for the New Testament it is **~72%**.

Since I'm a Data Scientist, I naturally wanted to dig into these numbers and ask more questions. The summary tables nicely show which books are covered and which are not. But what verses are actually covered? Is there something unique about those verses vs. those in the Lectionary (e.g. different sorts of themes)? In the future I plan to write another post on understanding the content via Natural Language Processing. For this post, I'll focus on creating a single *visualization* of the lectionary coverage for Sundays and Major Feasts to help me understand what parts are covered at a glance.

## Ok Cool, But Isn't the Lectionary a Book?

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BambergApocalypse06LargeInitialE.JPG#/media/File:BambergApocalypse06LargeInitialE.JPG"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/BambergApocalypse06LargeInitialE.JPG" alt="BambergApocalypse06LargeInitialE.JPG" height="480" width="360"></a><br></p>

Yes, the lectionary is traditionally a book. But it's the 21<sup>st</sup> century and luckily someone else has transcribed this into an electronic listing so I didn't have to do it. The data necessary includes the [Sunday Lectionary](http://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/Index-Sundays.htm) and a pair of reference guides that tell us how many chapters/verses are in each book of the Bible ([Old Testament Reference](http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/OT-Statistics-Compared.htm), [New Testament Reference](http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT-Statistics-Greek.htm)). I could have played with web scraping but there were only a few tables so I just copied the tables in Felix's website into Excel files ([link to data files](https://github.com/stefanavey/stefanavey.github.io/tree/master/_posts/catholic/plotBible)).

# Data Overview 

## Reference Data

There is a lot of data transformation necessary but in the end, we have a data frame with `r comma(nrow(ref2Pos))` rows which contains 1 row for every verse in the Catholic Bible. This will be used as the reference to compare the lectionary to. Below I show part of the table containing the first and last 6 verses.

```{r, results = "asis"}

ref2Pos %>%
    select(Testament, Section, Book, Chapter, Verse, Pos) %>%
    head() %>%
    knitr::kable()

ref2Pos %>%
    select(Testament, Section, Book, Chapter, Verse, Pos) %>%
    tail() %>%
    knitr::kable()


```

## Lectionary Data

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE}

###################################################
## Read in the Lectionary for Sundays and Feasts ##
###################################################
LectSundays <- map(readings, ~read_excel(LectSundaysFile, sheet = .x))
names(LectSundays) <- readings

SunLect <- bind_rows(LectSundays) %>%
    tbl_df() %>%
    separate(LectNum_Year, c("LectNum", "Year"), sep = '-') %>%
    mutate(YearA = grepl("A", Year),
           YearB = grepl("B", Year),
           YearC = grepl("C", Year)) %>%
    mutate(LectNum = as.numeric(LectNum))

#########################################
## Read in the Lectionary for Weekdays ##
#########################################
LectWeekdays <- map(readings, ~read_excel(LectWeekdaysFile, sheet = .x))
names(LectWeekdays) <- readings

wdLect <- bind_rows(LectWeekdays) %>%
    tbl_df() %>%
    mutate(Year1 = str_detect(Year, "1"),
           Year2 = str_detect(Year, "2"))

```

Below are some entries in the lectionary including the **Reading** as well as the **Year** in the 3-year cycle (ABC means read in years A, B, and C). For this analysis, I'll ignore the **Year** and just consider the coverage over the whole 3-year cycle.

```{r}

SunLect %>%
    select(Reading, LectNum, Year, Day) %>%
    head() %>%
    kable()

wdLect %>%
    select(Reading, LectNum, Year, Day) %>%
    head() %>%
    kable()

```

# Methodology

## Parsing Verses

The crucial part is matching the **Reading** to the reference. This seems straightforward but can be very tricky in some cases.  I wrote a basic parser ([see code](https://github.com/stefanavey/stefanavey.github.io/blob/master/_posts/catholic/plotBible/helperFunctions.R)) to handle the most common cases. It ignores some aspects such as the "or" option as in the first row of the table above. Usually an "or" option gives a longer form followed by a shorter form (subset of the first option) so I'll only consider the longer forms.

Each set of continuous verses gets stored in a new data frame by the parser.  For example, *`r SunLect$Reading[1]`* will get parsed to:

```{r}

ParseFull(SunLect$Reading[1])

```

and *`r SunLect$Reading[2]`* will get parsed to:

```{r}

ParseFull(SunLect$Reading[2])

```

Then, once each reading from the lectionary is parsed, it gets matched back to the reference.

```{r parsing}

## Apply parser on the full Sunday Lectionary
res <- SunLect %>%
    mutate(Pos = map(Reading, function(x) {
        ## cat(x, sep = '\n') # debugging
        ParseFull(x) %>%
        left_join(ref2Pos, by = c(start = "Chapter_Verse", Abbrv = "Abbrv")) %>%
        left_join(ref2Pos, by = c(end = "Chapter_Verse", Abbrv = "Abbrv")) %>%
        rowwise() %>%
            do(data.frame(Pos = if (any(is.na(.))) {
                                    NA
                                } else {
                                    .$Pos.x:.$Pos.y
                                }
                          )) %>%
            pull(Pos)}))

## Combine the results with the reference
sun_data <- res %>%
    unnest(Pos) %>%
    left_join(ref2Pos, by = "Pos")


## Apply parser on the full Weekday Lectionary
res <- wdLect %>%
    mutate(Pos = map(Reading, function(x) {
        ## cat(x, sep = '\n') # debugging
        ParseFull(x) %>%
        left_join(ref2Pos, by = c(start = "Chapter_Verse", Abbrv = "Abbrv")) %>%
        left_join(ref2Pos, by = c(end = "Chapter_Verse", Abbrv = "Abbrv")) %>%
        rowwise() %>%
            do(data.frame(Pos = if (any(is.na(.))) {
                                    NA
                                } else {
                                    .$Pos.x:.$Pos.y
                                }
                          )) %>%
            pull(Pos)}))

## Combine the results with the reference
wd_data <- res %>%
    unnest(Pos) %>%
    left_join(ref2Pos, by = "Pos")

```

```{r combine_data}

full_data <- bind_rows(sun_data, wd_data)

```

```{r debug, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

## Debugging
wd_data %>%
    filter(is.na(Pos)) %>%
    pull(Reading) %>%
    unique()

## TODO: Replace all "+" with "," and fix other parsing failures in data
## NOTE: Consider re-copying the data from website and then making all changes in the code since may have changed source files previously to correct errors.
ParseFull("Jer 31:10, 11-12ab[cd], 13")

```

So each reading is parsed into multiple segments and then mapped onto the position variable (**Pos**) from the Reference. The result for one reading looks like this:

```{r}

sun_data %>%
    select(Reading, Section, Book, Chapter, Verse, Pos) %>%
    filter(Reading == "Isa 63:16b-17, 19b; 64:2-7") %>%
    kable()

```

# Analysis Questions

## Are shorter books better covered?

It appears that there is no consistent relationship between book length (number of verses) and the percent read in the lectionary.

```{r length_unread, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10}

verse_per_book <- ref2Pos %>%
    group_by(Book, Abbrv, Testament, Section) %>%
    summarize(N_Verses = n())

verse_read <- full_data %>%
    filter(!is.na(Pos)) %>%
    group_by(Book, Abbrv, Testament, Section) %>%
    summarize(N_Read = length(unique(Pos)))
    
unread_df <- left_join(verse_per_book, verse_read,
                    by = c("Book", "Abbrv", "Testament", "Section")) %>%
    mutate(N_Read = ifelse(is.na(N_Read), 0, N_Read)) %>%
    mutate(N_Unread = N_Verses - N_Read) %>%
    mutate(Perc_Read = N_Read / N_Verses) %>%
    mutate(Section = factor(Section, levels = names(sections)))

ggplot(data = unread_df, aes(x = N_Verses, y = Perc_Read, label = Abbrv)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_label() +
    xlab("Book Length (Number of Verses)") +
    ylab("Percent Read in Lectionary (Sundays and Weekdays)") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) percent(x, accuracy = 1)) +
    facet_grid(Section ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
    getBaseTheme() +
    theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face='bold'))
    
```

## What books are not read or rarely read?

### Metric: Verses

The table below shows the data and you can sort by either quantity unread (**N\_Unread**) or percent unread (**Perc\_Unread**).

```{r unread_table}

unread_df %>%
    select(Testament, Section, Abbrv, N_Verses, N_Read, N_Unread, Perc_Read) %>%
    DT::datatable()

not_covered <- unread_df %>%
    filter(N_Read == 0) %>%
    arrange(Section) %>%
    pull(Abbrv)

```

The following books are not covered at all in the 3 year Sundays and Major Feast cycle: `r paste(not_covered, collapse = ', ')`

### Metric: Fragmentation?

We want a metric that penalizes large stretches of unread verses more than unread verses in close proximity to read verses. The ideal score would be 1 (completely read) and worst score would be 0 (completely not read). 

<!-- TODO: Define and use this metric -->

## What verses are most frequently read in Lectionary?

We want to see what verses are read most often at Mass.

```{r frequent_verses}

verse_read <- full_data %>%
    filter(!is.na(Pos)) %>%
    group_by(Book, Abbrv, Testament, Section, Chapter, Verse) %>%
    summarize(Count = n()) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(-Count) %>%
    mutate(verse_id = paste(api_book_map[Book], Chapter, Verse, sep = "."))

verse_read %>%
    select(Testament, Section, Abbrv, Chapter, Verse, Count) %>%
    DT::datatable()

```

We can see that the most highly read verses are from the Psalms, which is not surprising as the book of Psalms is read at nearly every mass during the responsorial.

The most read verse is:

```{r, results = "asis"}

## Get an ID that API can use to look up the verse.
cat(lookup_verse(verse_id = verse_read[["verse_id"]][1]))

```

```{r call_api, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

verse_id <- "MAT.1.2"

## Get a passage
passage_id <- "JHN.3.16-JHN.3.19"
request <- paste0(
    "curl --request GET \\",
    "--url https://api.scripture.api.bible/v1/bibles/",
    bible_id, "/passages/", passage_id,
    "?content-type=text \\",
    "--header 'api-key: ", API_BIBLE_KEY, "\'")
tmp <- system(request, intern = TRUE)
fromJSON(tmp)$data$content

## Search
search <- "Psalm%203%98.3"
request <- paste0(
    "curl --request GET \\",
    "--url https://api.scripture.api.bible/v1/bibles/",
    bible_id,
    "/search?query=", search,
    " \\",
    "--header 'api-key: ", API_BIBLE_KEY, "\'")
tmp <- system(request, intern = TRUE)
html_text(read_html(fromJSON(tmp)$data$passages$content))

```

# Visualizations

## "Bookshelf" Visualization

The inspiration behind this visualization is picturing the whole Bible as a bookshelf. There is one row for each major section (e.g., Torah, Minor Prophets, Gospels) and each section is made up of multiple books. In the visualization, lines are used to indicate coverage of a particular verse in the lectionary.

```{r viz_bookshelf, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 15, warning = FALSE}

## Get all section lengths
sectPos <- map_int(names(sections), function(sect) {
    abbrvs <- sections[[sect]]
    lastAbbrv <- abbrvs[length(abbrvs)]
    maxPos <- ref2Pos %>%
        filter(Abbrv == lastAbbrv) %>%
        pull(Pos) %>%
        max()
    return(maxPos)
})
names(sectPos) <- names(sections)
sectPos2 <- c(0, sectPos[-length(sectPos)])
names(sectPos2) <- names(sectPos)
sectLength <- sectPos - sectPos2

## Tweak Section Labels for Plot
sectLabels <- names(sections) %>%
    paste0(., " (V=", comma(sectLength[.]), ")") %>%
    str_replace("Prophets", " Prophets") %>%
    str_replace("NT", "New Testament") %>%
    setNames(names(sections))

## Generate plotting data
plot_data <- full_data %>%
    filter(!is.na(Pos)) %>%
    select(Section, Abbrv, Chapter, Verse, Pos) %>%
    mutate(Pos = (Pos - sectPos2[Section]) / sectLength[Section]) %>%
    mutate(SectionLabel = factor(sectLabels[Section],
                                 levels = sectLabels)) %>%
    mutate(Label = paste0(Abbrv, " ", Chapter, ":", Verse)) %>%
    distinct()      # ignore how many times something appeared (read 2 or 3 times)
book_dat <- ref2Pos %>%
    mutate(Abbrv = factor(Abbrv, levels = unique(Abbrv))) %>%
    mutate(Pos = (Pos - sectPos2[Section]) / sectLength[Section]) %>%
    mutate(SectionLabel = factor(sectLabels[Section],
                                 levels = sectLabels)) %>%
    group_by(SectionLabel, Abbrv) %>%
    summarize(Pos = min(Pos)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    group_by(SectionLabel) %>%
    mutate(y = rep(c(0, 0.33, 0.66, 1), length.out = n())) %>%
    ungroup()

cols <- rep(brewer.pal(n = 5, name = "Set2"), length.out = length(unique(plot_data$Abbrv)))
names(cols) <- unique(plot_data$Abbrv)

## Create the plot
gg <- ggplot(plot_data, x = 0, y = 1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = Pos, color = Abbrv), show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_label(data = book_dat, aes(x = Pos, y = y, label = Abbrv),
               hjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
    scale_color_manual(values = cols) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) +

    facet_grid(SectionLabel ~ ., scales = "fixed") +
    getBaseTheme() +
    theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"))
plot(gg)

```

```{r}

GetCoverage <- function(abbrv) {
    tot <- ref2Pos %>%
        filter(Abbrv == abbrv) %>%
        select(Chapter_Verse) %>%
        distinct() %>%
        nrow()
    cov <- plot_data %>%
        filter(Abbrv == abbrv) %>%
        select(Pos) %>%
        distinct() %>%
        nrow()
    return(cov/tot)
}

The amount of white space clearly shows what parts of the Bible are not contained in the lectionary. For example, in the New Testament section (bottom row of the "bookshelf"), it is apparent that little of the book of *Acts* (coverage = `r percent(GetCoverage("Acts"), accuracy = 1)`) or *Revelation* (coverage = `r percent(GetCoverage("Rev"), accuracy = 1)`) are in the Sunday lectionary. 

While most of the Old Testament is sparsely covered, the Psalms (abbreviated *Ps*) are one of the most covered books at `r percent(GetCoverage("Ps"), accuracy = 1)` coverage. One of the drawbacks of this visualization is that each row contains a different number of verses so that the visual sense of "fullness" can be deceiving.

## Barplot

Now, instead of visualizing the covered verses in order, consider just the question of how much of each book in the Bible is covered by the Catholic Lectionary?

```{r viz_barplot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}

verse_per_book <- ref2Pos %>%
    group_by(Book, Abbrv, Testament, Section) %>%
    summarize(N_Verses = n()) %>%
    ungroup()

verse_read <- full_data %>%
    filter(!is.na(Pos)) %>%
    group_by(Book, Abbrv, Testament, Section) %>%
    summarize(N_Read = length(unique(Pos))) %>%
    ungroup()
    
plot_data <- left_join(verse_per_book, verse_read,
                    by = c("Book", "Abbrv", "Testament", "Section")) %>%
    mutate(N_Read = ifelse(is.na(N_Read), 0, N_Read)) %>%
    mutate(N_Unread = N_Verses - N_Read) %>%
    mutate(Perc_Read = N_Read / N_Verses) %>%
    mutate(Section = factor(Section, levels = names(sections))) %>%
    arrange(Perc_Read) %>%
    mutate(Abbrv = factor(Abbrv, levels = unique(Abbrv)))

cols <- brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "Dark2")[c(1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 6, 5)]
names(cols) <- levels(plot_data$Section)

ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(x = Abbrv, y = Perc_Read, fill = Section)) +
    geom_col() +
    coord_flip() +
    xlab("Book") +
    ylab("Percent Read in Lectionary") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) percent(x, accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cols) +
    labs(caption = paste("Includes Sundays and Major Feasts (3 year cycle)",
                         "plus Weekdays (2 year cycle)")) +
    getBaseTheme() +
    theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face='bold'),
          legend.pos = "top")
    
```
